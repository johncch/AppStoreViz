# App Store Visualization

## Introduction
This is the final piece to the App Store Visualization project for http://golancourses.net/2011spring/

Runs on eclipse. Requires scraping the data using the AppStoreScraperJS then prepping the data using AppStoreDataCleanup.

Has some nasty fixed paths inside so just remove it if you need to run it. This is totally not optimised for normal use - I'm just hoping if anyone finds it it'll be of some sort of academic interest.
